# Frecuency-plot-package

This is a project to learn how to create Python packages and upload them to PyPi.org. I have created the Countplot class, which is used to visualize in a bar plot the frecuency of occurrence of a unique value list contained in an list-like column
    
    Attributes:
        - Color (string): the color of the bars in the plot
        - N_bars (int): number of top values that appear in the plot
        - Size (float array 2x1): size of the visualization
        - Title (string): title of the plot
        - Sep_type: separator between values in the original column
        - data: a list-like column
